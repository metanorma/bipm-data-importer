  x-content: The CIPM considered a request from an _association of 'anciens'_ of the
    BIPM to have a representative or observer on the PFAB. The CIPM noted that it
    maintains a high standard for transparency with respect to the operation and financial
    status of the Pension Fund. It also noted that the PFAB now includes an elected
    representative of the BIPM active staff and that active staff have a natural interest
    in the rights and benefits that they will receive as pensioners. The CIPM therefore
    does not consider it necessary to include a representative or observer of the
    association on the PFAB at this time.
